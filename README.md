# 🗃️ SQL Portfolio – Daily Practice with Realistic Databases

Welcome to my SQL practice portfolio! This repository documents my **daily SQL learning journey** through hands-on problem solving using two structured and realistic databases:

- 🎬 **DVD Rentals** – A sample movie rental store database
- 🏫 **DEM_School** – A school-style academic database

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build consistency, sharpen my SQL querying skills, and showcase my ability to work with relational databases through daily problem-solving. This project also serves as a public portfolio to demonstrate practical SQL knowledge in real-world scenarios.
