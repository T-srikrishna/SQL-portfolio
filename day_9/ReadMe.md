### ðŸ“Š Monthly Rental Trends in 2005  
**Scenario:**  
The business analyst needs to understand rental activity patterns throughout 2005 to identify seasonal trends or shifts in demand.

**Task:**  
Calculate the total number of rentals for each month in 2005.

**What I used:**  
- `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM rental_date)` to filter rentals in 2005  
- `TO_CHAR(rental_date, 'Month')` to group results by month name  
- `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` with `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM rental_date)` for correct month ordering  
- `COUNT(*)` to tally rentals per month  

**Tables Involved:**  
- `rental`

**Key Concepts Practiced:**  
- Using date/time functions to extract and format date parts  
- Grouping and ordering data for accurate time series analysis  
- Handling textual month names alongside numeric ordering

### ðŸŒ† City with the Highest Number of Customers  
**Scenario:**  
Marketing wants to target promotions and campaigns in the city with the largest customer base.

**Task:**  
Identify the city with the highest count of customers.

**What I used:**  
- Joining `city`, `address`, and `customer` tables to connect customers to cities

**Tables Involved:**  
- `city`  
- `address`

**Key Concepts Practiced:**  
- Multi-table joins to aggregate data across relationships  
- Filtering and ordering with `GROUP BY` for top-N queries  
- Understanding hierarchical relationships (city â†’ address â†’ customer)
